# Project 1
By Hlao Khang

## Project Description
- I will make a clone of the current homework

## Features
- blog posts
- index page

I think I'll try to play with the placements. I'm not too sure what to do with contentful beyond the blog thing.

I managed to get what I wanted which was this really cool hanging off look for the title and the images for the blog posts.
What kind of sucks is that the images are kind of low res. I still don't really understand the entirety of how graphql works
alongside gatsby. What's most interesting to me is gatsby-node.js.

Since Gatsby is based off of React, I kind of figured the way to get information would be via fetch. So either this is another
way to get information or I just don't know graphql well enough and graphql just doesn't need that.
